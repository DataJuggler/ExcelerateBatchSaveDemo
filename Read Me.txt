This project serves as a good demo of how to save to 3 sheets at once.

Run this project, select the sheet Props.xlsx, and click the Load Data button.

This project is just a simple demo of something I needed for 3D animating with IClone. I had a list of Prop Data, that was all
in a table in one column.

I code generated 3 classes * using Blazor Excelerate (https://excelerate.datajuggler.com), and used the 


* - A note about the code generation. To make sure my tables had the correct data type, I added some sample data to sheets
2 and 3, including values with decimal points, so that double were created not integers. Then I erased the sample data
and ran this program.

This program does the following:
1. Loads all data from a workbook (3 sheets, but only one sheet has data at first).
2. Extracts out every 6 rows, into a list of Prop objects.
3. Sorts the prop objects by Name then by Current Time, so Sheet 3 (SortedProp) is in order by prop (car).

All of the data is saved to Excel at once, using what is called a Batch.

A batch contains a list of BatchItems, and each worksheet has a BatchItems collection created.

For sheet one, the RowId is used to find the row from the worksheet, and when propData.Save() is called, the values are written
back to the row.

BatchItems2 and BatchItems3 are performing inserts, so NewRow is called on the Prop and SortedProp objects. 
Then Save is called o write the values back to the row.

Each BatchItem has an Updates property, and this property is a list of Rows to be written to the file.
